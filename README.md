# SkyGrid

 Inspired by [Sethbling's SkyGrid for Minecraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqfU-qZAZkM),
 Dr. Yamok Presents SkyGrid for Terraria. SkyGrid adds a single world generation step to every
 world: Make a grid. It smartly avoids damaging natural structures that you would want to
 remain intact, such as the Dungeon or the Temple, and avoids sending liquids to hell. If you
 and your friends are looking for a challenge, somethings that augments the world so
 fundamentally, then SkyGrid is for you.
